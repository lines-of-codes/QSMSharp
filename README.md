# QSMSharp

A Quick Server Manager for Minecraft, ironically written in C# and not Java.

This software plans to have basic server management and configuration,
mods/plugins management with modpack installation, and Java installation management.

This software stemmed from the fact that I love Prism Launcher's mod management
and wished for an open-source Minecraft server management with the same level of
capabilities.
