# QSMSharp

[![DeepSource](https://app.deepsource.com/gh/lines-of-codes/QSMSharp.svg/?label=code+coverage&show_trend=true&token=jM1AX4ulQuHoJzyLQRDv1Lg1)](https://app.deepsource.com/gh/lines-of-codes/QSMSharp/)

A Quick Server Manager for Minecraft, ironically written in C# and not Java.

This software plans to have basic server management and configuration,
mods/plugins management with modpack installation, and Java installation management.

This software stemmed from the fact that I love Prism Launcher's mod management 
and wished for an open-source Minecraft server management with the same level of 
capabilities.

## Projects

In the solution, There are three projects including:

- QSM.Core: Common classes shared between projects
- QSM.Web: Cross-platform web version of the management software
- QSM.Windows: Original Windows-only version, More complete
