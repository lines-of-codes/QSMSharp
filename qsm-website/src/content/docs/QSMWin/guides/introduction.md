beginners. Currently, There is a prerelease version available for download 
on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lines-of-codes/QSMSharp/releases).

## Setting up Java

You will need to set up a Java instance for your server first. You can go into
the Settings > Manage Java page and either import or download a Java Runtime.

If you wish to import, You will need to select your Java installation folder.
Your Java's installation folder is the path to your Java installation. It might be anywhere
depending on where you installed your Java, but usually, it would be in the 
`C:\Program Files\<Provider Name>\<Java Version>` (Such as, 
`C:\Program Files\Zulu\zulu-21` for Azul Zulu 21, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`
for Oracle Java SE 21)

If you wish to download, You can simply do that by going to the Download tab
within the Java Management page, select a Java version, then you can simply 
pick the latest build, and click Download.

If you do not know which Java version to pick, Generally:

- Java 8 for Minecraft 1.8 to 1.11
- Java 11 for Minecraft 1.12 to 1.16.5
- Java 17 for Minecraft 1.17 to 1.19.2
- Java 21 for Minecraft 1.20 and newer
