description: Where QSM stores its data.
---

Normally, QSM (Windows) stores its application data at `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\QSM`

Directory structure:

- config.json - Application Configuration File
- Servers \[folder\] - Stores the servers you've created
- Java \[folder\] - Stores the Java installations you've installed through QSM
- Logs \[folder\] - Store QSM logs
- Backups \[folder\] - Store server backups. Only delete the backups stored in this folder directly if it is not registered in the app.
- Downloads \[folder\] - Currently it only serves the purpose of storing modpack downloads. You can safely delete the contents of this folder.
