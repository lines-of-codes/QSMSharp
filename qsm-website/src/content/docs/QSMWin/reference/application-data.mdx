import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Normally, QSM (Windows) stores its application data at `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\QSM`

Directory structure:

<FileTree>
    
- config.json Application Configuration File
- Servers/ Stores the servers you've created
- Java/ Stores the Java installations you've installed through QSM
- Logs/ Store QSM logs
- Backups/ Store server backups. Only delete the backups stored in this folder directly if it is not registered in the app.
- Downloads/ Currently it only serves the purpose of storing modpack downloads. You can safely delete the contents of this folder.

</FileTree>
