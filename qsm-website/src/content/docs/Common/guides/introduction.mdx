QSM (Quick Server Manager) is a server management software
for the game Minecraft. It currently has a native Windows 
version and a web application version.

**QSM does not support hosting a Bedrock Edition Minecraft
server.** But you still can host a Java server with a plugin
which will make Bedrock edition players can join.

Even if QSM eases the process of self-hosting a Minecraft
server, it is still recommended that you understand some basics
of hosting a game server.

The Minecraft Wiki states the following ([source](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Setting_up_a_Java_Edition_server?oldid=3347971#User_knowledge)):

> In order to run your server correctly, we highly suggest that you should at least know about the following:
> - Technical game knowledge, such as commands, chunk, etc.
> - Using the command-line and editing configuration files
> - Networking in general (IP, ports, etc.)
> - System configuration

To start using QSM, Please pick between the QSM Windows version and the QSM Web 
version. QSM Web can run on Windows too, but QSM Windows will be more 
beginner-friendly to set up, as it is just like any other Windows program.
