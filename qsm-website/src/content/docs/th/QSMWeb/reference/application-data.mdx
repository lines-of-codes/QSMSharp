QSM Web store its data at the following location on various operating systems:

- Linux: `/var/lib/qsm-web`
- FreeBSD: `/usr/local/etc/qsm-web/`
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\QSMWeb\`
- macOS: Does not have a static location. Please help and contribute by adding a proper path to store data [here](https://github.com/lines-of-codes/QSMSharp/blob/c204ea5082e591fcaed1a1ed96cb89d880b7a64e/QSM.Web/Data/ApplicationConfig.cs#L11).

## Directory Structure

Similar to the nature of QSM Windows, QSM Web has the following filesystem structure:

<FileTree>
    
    - config.json Application-wide settings
    - downloads/
    - logs/
    - qbs/ QBS Installation Location
    - servers
        - [server_name]
            - config.qsm.json Server-specific QSM-only configuration
            - ...
    
</FileTree>
